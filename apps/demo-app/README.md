# Demo App

Full-featured demo of the Softa framework. Exercises most starters —
`metadata`, `reference-data`, `es`, `file`, `message`, `flow`, `studio`,
`user`, and `tenant`. Multi-tenancy and Ed25519 request signing are both
enabled, so it doubles as the reference topology for a signed Studio ⇄ runtime
deployment.

This README covers only how to run **this app**. For how the metadata
annotation scanner itself works — `scanner-scope`, the DDL auto-execute policy,
`renamedFrom` handling, the production drift checker, `app_code` identity — see
[`starters/metadata-starter/README.md`](../../starters/metadata-starter/README.md).

## Run locally (dev profile)

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
cd deploy/demo-app
docker-compose up -d mysql redis
```

`docker-compose.yml` provides **MySQL and Redis only**. The `es` / `file` /
`message` / `flow` / change-log features additionally need Elasticsearch, MinIO,
and Pulsar — start those from their supporting stacks under
[`deploy/`](../../deploy/) if you exercise them.

On first boot the MySQL container loads everything in
`deploy/demo-app/init_mysql/` in order: `1.Metadata.ddl.sql` (the `sys_*`
catalog + one table per starter entity), then the `2.*` / `3.*` / `4.*` DML
seeds. To bring an **existing** dev database forward instead, apply the scripts
under [`deploy/migrations/`](../../deploy/migrations/) (see its README for the
decision tree).

### 2. Run the app

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -pl apps/demo-app -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

`application-dev.yml` declares `system.app-code: demo-app` and sets
`system.metadata.scanner-scope: ["*"]`, which activates the
`MetadataAnnotationScanner`: on boot it reconciles every `@Model` / `@Field` /
`@OptionSet` / `@Index` on the classpath against the live `sys_*` rows for this
app and auto-applies the additive DDL. Watch for:

```
MetadataAnnotationScanner: scanner-scope active (matchAll=true), scanning classpath...
MetadataAnnotationScanner: applied N row change(s) to sys_*
DdlOrchestrator: CREATE TABLE currency OK
```

> **Never** set a non-empty `scanner-scope` on a production runtime — leave it
> empty so the read-only `MetadataAnnotationChecker` runs instead. The full
> dev-vs-prod policy lives in the metadata-starter README.

### 3. Verify

Catalog rows are scoped by **`app_code`**, not an `ownership` column (the
ownership tier was retired; annotation and Studio lanes reconcile the same
`sys_*` rows matched by business key).

```sql
SELECT model_name, app_code FROM sys_model
 WHERE app_code = 'demo-app';
```

returns the built-in system models plus the reference-data tables
(`CountryRegion`, `Currency`, …) the scanner reconciled for this runtime.

You can also confirm the runtime binding over HTTP:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/upgrade/runtime/runtimeInfo | jq .
# → { "appCode": "demo-app", "buildVersion": "...", "databaseType": "..." }
```
