 * separate namespaces — tenants own copies of their templates (initialized at
 * provisioning), the platform ({@code tenant_id = -1}) owns its own; there is
 * no overlay or fallback on the template axis. An explicit config/template id
 * on the request still wins over the policy.
 * <p>
 * Carried on {@code SendMailDTO.scope} / {@code SendSmsDTO.scope} and
 * {@code MailRequestMessage.scope}; {@code null} means {@link #TENANT}. With
 * multi-tenancy disabled there is a single namespace and the value has no
 * effect. The scope also selects the monthly-quota bucket the send consumes:
 * {@code PLATFORM} sends draw on the platform's own quota, never a tenant's.
