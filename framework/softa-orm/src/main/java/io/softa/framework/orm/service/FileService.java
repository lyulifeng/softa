     * waived, on the grounds that reading the row was already authorized — which only holds if the
     * id sitting in that column was put there legitimately. Nothing else validates it, so a caller
     * could otherwise write a stranger's file id into a row they may edit and read the file back
     * through the expansion.
     *
     * <p>Accepted:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Unclaimed, same model</b> — the create-form path: the file was uploaded before the row
     *       existed. Same-model rather than same-uploader on purpose, because uploader and saver are

     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Everything else — bound to another row, uploaded against another model, uploaded by another
     * tenant, or no such record — throws. Silently dropping the value was considered and rejected: a
     * dropped attachment looks to the user exactly like a saved one until they come back for it.
     *
     * <p>Batch-shaped on purpose: one write hands over every File-field statement it carries, all ids
     * are fetched in a single read, and each statement is checked against it in memory — the ownership
     * cost of a write does not grow with its row count.
     *
     * @param modelName the model being written
     * @param statements one per (row, field) the write carries, each naming the ids the field is being

     * <p>Releasing is the other half. A write that carried a File field is a complete statement about
