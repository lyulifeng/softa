     *
     * <p>Why login has to consult it: while seeding is in flight the tenant is half-built (its roles, org
     * masters and option items arrive over MQ, out of order), so a user let in early sees a workspace that is
     * missing pieces and can create records that reference masters which do not exist yet. It also makes
     * discarding a failed setup safe: if nobody can log in before READY, then every row in a not-yet-READY
     * tenant was written by a seeder, and deleting them cannot destroy anyone's work.
     *
     * <p>Defaulted to {@code true} rather than declared abstract, and that is about this being a published
     * SPI: an abstract addition breaks every external implementor's compile on an upgrade that changes nothing
     * they asked for. The default is also the honest answer for them — a deployment that tracks no provisioning
     * axis has no tenant that is "not built yet", so the gate degrades to {@link #isTenantActive} alone, which
     * is exactly the pre-existing behaviour.

     *   <li>evicts the tenant caches, so {@link #isTenantActive} and active-id filtering see the change at
     *       once. Users of a tenant leaving ACTIVE are then forced to re-login on their next request (the
     *       per-request gate rejects them and drops their session).</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * Without the eviction a suspension does not take effect until the cache expires — the tenant's users
     * keep working meanwhile — which is why the status column must not be exposed as an editable field.
