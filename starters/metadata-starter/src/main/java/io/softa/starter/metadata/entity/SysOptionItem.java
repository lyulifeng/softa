// Names have to be unique too, because a name is what people type. Import columns are moving to
// accept the displayed name rather than the code, and a name matching two items leaves the importer
// nothing to choose between — both rows are valid answers to what it was asked.
//
// Scoped to the set alone, not to (app, set). An option set is addressed globally by its code:
// SysOptionSet declares businessKey = {optionSetCode}, and OptionManager resolves items through
// (optionSetCode, itemCode) and (optionSetCode, label), taking no appCode at all. Two apps defining
// the same set code is therefore already unresolvable at runtime — keying the index by app would
// permit that state rather than prevent it.
//
// Platform sets are flat, so whole-set uniqueness is the right scope here. Tenant-authored sets are
// NOT: `ResignationReason` deliberately carries four items labelled "Others", one under each
// `ResignationType`, and only one is ever visible at a time. Their uniqueness is per parent, which
// needs a different index — see the wiki design note, not this file.
