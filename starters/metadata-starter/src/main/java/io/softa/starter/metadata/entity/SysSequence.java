/**
 * Sequence generator configuration and counter.
 * Each row holds a single (tenant, code) counter plus its rendering template
 * and reset / mode policy. Allocation goes through
 * {@code io.softa.framework.orm.sequence.SequenceService} (port in softa-orm,
 * implementation in this starter).
 *
 * <p>v1 hard rules (by convention — config-API enforcement is deferred):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code code} matches {@code "<ModelName>.<fieldName>"} for
 *       fields participating in auto-fill (see SequenceProcessor).</li>
 *   <li>{@code incrementStep == 1}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code code} is not changed after creation; rows are provisioned via
 *       the framework's {@code loadPreTenantData} on JSON files for tenant
 *       bootstrap, not created ad hoc through the API.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There is no {@code status} column: a row's existence equals "active".
 * Emergency disable is a DBA-only operation (DELETE the row, optionally
 * preserving {@code currentValue} elsewhere if a later restoration is
 * needed).

     * create-or-update, so a seed that carries the counter rewinds a live one every time it is
     * re-applied, and the sequence then re-issues numbers it already handed out until it climbs
     * back past the highest one in use. That surfaces far from its cause — as a duplicate-key
     * error on the business table, with the code field left blank on screen.
     *
     * <p>Omitting it from the seed is necessary but not sufficient, which is what {@code readonly}
     * is here for. {@code loadPreTenantData}'s update branch is a whole-row reconcile: it writes an
     * explicit null for every updatable field the file does NOT mention, so leaving the counter out
     * used to null it — the mirror of the rewind above, and worse, because a NULL counter can no
     * longer advance ({@code current_value + step} is NULL) and reads as a fresh row, re-issuing
     * numbers from {@code startValue}. Marked readonly, it is not an updatable field, so no re-load
     * can touch it either way — a readonly field is dropped from the write payload rather than
     * rejected, so the loader's null never reaches the column. The allocator is unaffected: it
     * advances the counter in its own {@code UPDATE} through {@code JdbcProxy}, below the field
     * processors. A first insert leaves the column out entirely and takes the DB-level default this
     * {@code defaultValue} is materialized into, which is why the declared 0 still lands on a new row.
