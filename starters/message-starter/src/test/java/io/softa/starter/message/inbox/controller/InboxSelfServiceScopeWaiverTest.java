/**
 * The notification bell must not be subject to row scope.
 *
 * <p>{@code InboxNotification} is anchorless — nothing a business role is granted references it — so
 * {@code PermissionServiceImpl.scopeWithoutGrant} finds no referencer and fails closed to
 * {@code matchNone()}. Every {@code my*} endpoint already pins its rows to {@code requireUserId()},
 * so the check cannot narrow anything; it can only empty the result.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is worth pinning</b>: it empties silently. The bell reports zero unread and an empty
 * list, which reads as "no notifications" rather than as a failure — the same defect on
 * {@code UserProfile} announced itself as a 400 and was fixed within the hour, while this one can sit
 * in a release indefinitely. Nobody files a bug against a quiet bell.
 *
 * <p>The waiver belongs on the controller, not on {@link InboxNotificationService}: this is the layer
 * that takes the id from the request context. The service methods take {@code recipientId} as a
 * parameter, and the second test keeps them checked — waiving those would hand whatever passes an id
 * next somebody else's inbox.
