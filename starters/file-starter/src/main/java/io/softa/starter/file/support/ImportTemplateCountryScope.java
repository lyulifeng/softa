/**
 * The one rule for which import templates a caller may see: their own countries' plus the ones with
 * no country, which apply everywhere.
 *
 * <p>Import templates are not on the country axis — a template with no country is the common case
 * (job grades, cost centres, departments have no country dimension), so the ORM's per-country
 * narrowing leaves the model alone. Every read that lists templates therefore states the rule itself:
 * the import dialog's picker, the administration list, the reference picker behind a Template field,
 * and the export of the list. Held here so they all state the same one.
 *
 * <p>Written as <b>country is null OR country in (my countries)</b>, never a bare membership test —
 * that would empty every listing for every tenant, since most rows hold null. The set is the caller's
 * own countries, resolved the same way {@code MultiCountryScope} resolves them; when nothing is known
 * the filter is skipped rather than tightened. Resolved from the request context, never from the
 * payload.
