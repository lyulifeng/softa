/**
 * Re-evaluates role.dynamic_filter for every active role and synchronizes
 * the user_role table (source=DYNAMIC rows only). Runs on a Spring cron
 * schedule (default: every night at 02:00).
 *
 * Algorithm (per role with non-null dynamic_filter):
 *   1. Run the filter as ORM query → set of currently-matching user IDs.
 *   2. Diff against existing user_role rows where role_id=R AND source=DYNAMIC.
 *   3. INSERT new matches, DELETE rows no longer matching.
 *   4. Manual rows (source=MANUAL) are never touched.
 *   5. Affected user IDs are batch-evicted from PermissionInfo cache.
 *
 * INNER JOIN employee in the underlying SQL means pure users (no employee
 * record) are NEVER matched by dynamic rules — they can only be assigned
 * roles MANUALLY.

     * running the body, so the param truly scopes the execution.

     * business events into this call.
