/**
 * A built-in role's access is fixed: a role carrying a {@code code} cannot have its definition or its
 * grants written through the API. Assigning and unassigning users is the one change that stays open.
 *
 * <p>The grants are three ordinary models — {@code RoleNavigation} (which pages), {@code RoleDataScope}
 * (which rows), {@code RoleSensitiveFieldSet} (which fields unmasked) — plus {@code Role} itself. They
 * are guarded at the HTTP surface by {@link io.softa.starter.user.controller.SystemRoleGuardedController},
 * which declares every write verb so none of them can slip through the generic {@code /{modelName}}
 * route unchecked. This class holds the decision; that class decides where it is asked.
 *
 * <p>What was reachable before this existed, on a live tenant: {@code POST /RoleDataScope/updateOne}
 * naming the EMPLOYEE role's row on the {@code Employee} model and setting {@code scopeType: ALL} —
 * one call, and every employee in that tenant reads every colleague's record. {@code SUPER_ADMIN} and
 * {@code TENANT_ADMIN} happen to be immune (their access is computed at runtime and their static rows
 * are ignored), which is exactly why the hole was easy to miss: the two roles an operator would think
 * to test are the two that do not react.
 *
 * <h3>What still passes</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Membership.</b> {@code UserRoleRel} has no guarded controller — adding and removing users is
 *       the point of a built-in role, not a modification of it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Seeding and system maintenance.</b> Anything running with {@code skipPermissionCheck} is let
 *       through: that is what pre-data loading sets on both its tenant and system paths, and what the
 *       entitlement downgrade cleanup runs under when it strips over-plan grants. A request arriving
 *       from a user never carries it — not even a super admin's, whose bypass is expressed through
 *       {@code PermissionInfo.isAdmin}, not through this flag.</li>
 *   <li><b>Service-layer callers.</b> This guard sits at the HTTP surface, so framework-internal writes
 *       (a cascade, a seeder, the entitlement cleanup) are unaffected — they were never the threat.</li>
 * </ul>
