/**
 * The PERSON's AUTHENTICATION — login identifiers and the password, split out from {@link UserProfile}.
 *
 * <p>Why its own model rather than columns on the profile: credentials and personal information are
 * different concerns with opposite exposure. A directory of people's names and photos is ordinary
 * browsable data; a password hash is not. Keeping them on one model meant any decision about exposing
 * one applied to the other as well. Separated, {@code UserProfile} carries a normal CRUD surface and
 * this model is reached by the credential paths in typed service code.
 *
 * <p>Served by the generic {@code ModelController} surface like any other registered model, gated by
 * role grants and the endpoint registry. A platform super-admin bypasses that gate, as it does
 * everywhere.
 *
 * <p>Global, exactly like the profile: a person has ONE set of credentials no matter how many
 * companies employ them. One row per person, linked 1:1 to {@link UserProfile} via {@code profileId}
 * (the FK is here, not on the profile, so the credential path resolves an identity straight from an
 * account's {@code profileId} without loading the profile at all). {@code onDelete = CASCADE}: deleting
 * a person deletes their credentials with them, so a tenant purge that clears profiles leaves no
 * orphaned identity behind.

// The login identifiers ARE unique, and have to be: login resolves a person by one of them, so two
// people holding the same value cannot be told apart — a code sent there says nothing about which
// of them is signing in, and resolution can only refuse. Enforced by the database rather than by
// application code, because the check and the write would otherwise race.
//
// NULLs are the point of leaving these nullable: MySQL allows many rows to be null in a unique
// index, and most people have only one channel. A shared work number simply does not become
// anyone's identifier — see UserIdentityService.isIdentifierClaimable, which is what keeps the
// seeding paths from manufacturing a collision out of an ordinary shared contact.
//
// Reusing a leaver's address is still possible: off-boarding RELEASES the identifiers this company
// issued (UserAccountService.releaseLoginIdentifiers), so the value is free before the new hire
// needs it. That release is what makes these indexes safe to hold.
