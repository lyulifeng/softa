 * What the /join landing page may show for a token, and why.

 * <p>PRD §3.0 checks five things IN ORDER and lands the first four on the same "link expired"
 * screen. Collapsing them into one boolean would be enough for the UI but not for support: the
 * reason is what tells HR whether to re-send, to re-invite, or to tell the person they already
 * joined. So the reason travels even though the screen is shared.
 *
 * @param usable       whether the person may proceed to identity verification
 * @param reason       why not, when {@code usable} is false
 * @param companyName  the inviting company, for the verification screen
 * @param employeeName the invitee's name, shown on the confirm-join screen so they can spot a
 *                     mis-addressed invitation before accepting it (PRD §3.3)
 * @param maskedEmail  masked work email, or null when the invitation had none
 * @param maskedMobile masked work mobile, or null when the invitation had none
