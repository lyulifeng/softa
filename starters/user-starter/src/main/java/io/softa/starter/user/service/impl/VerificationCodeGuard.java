/**
 * The abuse limits around one-time verification codes, in one place.
 *
 * <p>A code by itself proves nothing without these: a 6-digit code is 10^6 wide, so unlimited
 * attempts break it in minutes and unlimited sends turn the SMS bill into the attack. The five
 * rules are deliberately different in kind:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>60s between sends</b> — stops accidental double-taps and cheap flooding;</li>
 *   <li><b>≤10 sends per channel per day</b> — bounds the cost of a determined flooder;</li>
 *   <li><b>5 wrong tries kills the code</b> — bounds guesses per issued code;</li>
 *   <li><b>10 consecutive wrong tries bans the channel for 30 minutes</b> — bounds guesses
 *       across codes, which the per-code limit alone would let a caller reset by re-sending;</li>
 *   <li><b>the ban gates sending too</b>, otherwise "request a new code" is the reset.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Counters are per identifier</b> (this phone number / this email), never per account: the
 * caller has not proven who they are yet, so an account-keyed counter would be both bypassable
 * (switch channel) and a denial-of-service vector against someone else's account.
 *
 * <p>Everything lives in the cache with its own TTL, so state expires on its own — nothing to
 * clean up, and a restart loses only in-flight attempt counts (fail-open on those is acceptable;
 * the daily cap and the ban, which bound real abuse, are the ones with long TTLs).
