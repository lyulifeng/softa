/**
 * Typed {@code GET /me/uiContext} response — exactly the permission-snapshot fields the frontend
 * reads, plus {@code entitledModules} appended by {@code MeController}. Normalizes the TWO sources
 * to one shape: a cache hit (the engine's serialized {@code PermissionInfo} JSON, read via
 * {@code CacheService}) and the cold-cache fallback ({@code UiContextBuilder}).
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a SUBSET of the engine's {@code PermissionInfo}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>no {@code superAdmin} — the FE derives it from {@code roleCodes.contains("SUPER_ADMIN")};</li>
 *   <li>no {@code permissionCodes} — server-side only, the FE never reads it;</li>
 *   <li>no {@code modelScopeMap} — server-side row-filtering only, and its {@code ScopeRule} type
 *       lives in permission-starter, which user-starter must not depend on (⊥).</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@link JsonIgnoreProperties}{@code (ignoreUnknown = true)} lets a cache hit deserialize the richer
 * {@code PermissionInfo} JSON into this subset without failing on those extra fields.
