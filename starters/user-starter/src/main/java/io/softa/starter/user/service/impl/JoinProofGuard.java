/**
 * The proof that a /join caller passed the verification code, carried across the two anonymous
 * steps that follow it.
 *
 * <p>POST /login/setJoinPassword and /login/confirmJoin have no session; what authorized them was
 * the invitation token plus a caller-supplied profileId. For a row already bound to a person the
 * profileId is the whole tie — and it is readable off the roster. A company holding a re-hired
 * person's work mailbox (where the link lands) could therefore skip the code entirely, call
 * setJoinPassword with the token and that person's id, set their GLOBAL password, and sign in as
 * them at every other company they belong to. The proof closes that: verifyJoinCode mints it only
 * once a code actually passed, and both later steps refuse without one naming THIS invitation and
 * THIS person.
 *
 * <p>Stored hashed, keyed by its own digest, the way the invitation token is: a cache dump then
 * yields nothing replayable. The value names the invitation by its token hash so a proof minted
 * for one link cannot be spent on another, and the profileId so it cannot be spent on another
 * person even under the same link. It lives 15 minutes — long enough to type a password and press
 * Join, short enough that an abandoned tab is not a standing credential — and confirmJoin consumes
 * it on success so the completed flow leaves nothing behind.
