     *   <li><b>the membership is detached</b> ({@code profileId} and {@code activationTime}

     *   <li><b>the new work contacts are recorded</b>, refusing an address another account already
     *       holds rather than surfacing a constraint violation;</li>

     * what this row represents. Off-boarding clears them because the position itself is closing;
     * unbinding is the opposite — the position stands and only its holder was wrong.

     *               that detaches a person from a membership that keeps its authority, and
