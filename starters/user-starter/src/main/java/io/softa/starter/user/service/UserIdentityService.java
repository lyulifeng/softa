/**
 * The person's credentials: persistence AND the rules for reading and writing them.
 *
 * <p>One service, not two. "Where is the password" has to have exactly one answer — before the
 * credentials had a model of their own, that meant a separate seam ({@code UserCredentialService})
 * sitting in front of whichever model happened to hold them, because four services were hashing and
 * comparing passwords themselves and moving the storage meant finding every one of them. Now that
 * the credentials ARE a model, this service is that seam, and a second one in front of it would only
 * add a hop.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately exposes no unguarded lookup. Fetching an identity by profile id or by login
 * identifier is possible, but only through the methods below: a bare finder returning an empty
 * Optional invites the caller to read "no credentials" as "this person has no password", which is
 * how a password-less path gets opened. {@link #requireIdentity} refuses loudly instead.
 *
 * <p>Scoped to callers of this service; the generic {@code ModelController} surface reaches the model
 * directly.
