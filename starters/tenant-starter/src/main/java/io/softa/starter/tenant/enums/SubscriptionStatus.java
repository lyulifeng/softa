/**
 * A tenant's subscription standing, projected onto its {@code TenantSubscription} row from the period
 * detail rows as of that tenant's local today. Never written by hand — the projection refresh is the
 * only writer.
 *
 * <h3>Names are deliberately neutral</h3>
 * The displayed wording lives in the option-item labels (seed data), so a deployment can relabel without
 * touching code. Two naming choices matter:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code PAID}, not {@code ACTIVE}</b> — {@code TenantStatus.ACTIVE} already means "may log in"
 *       (the operational axis). The two axes are orthogonal and can contradict: a tenant can be suspended
 *       by ops while still inside a paid period.</li>
 *   <li><b>No blanket {@code FREE} / {@code AT_FLOOR}</b> — the free plan is a period like any other now,
 *       so its standing follows from its dates: {@link #TRIAL} while the row is open, {@link #EXPIRED} once
 *       an operator gives it an end date that passes. Avoiding the word "free" also keeps the enum honest on
 *       a deployment whose lowest tier is paid.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Four states, not five</h3>
 * {@code NEVER_SUBSCRIBED} meant "no period rows at all", which every tenant passed through at birth.
 * Provisioning now writes a free period at creation, so that state became unreachable — a tenant always has
 * at least one row and its standing is always derivable from dates. Keeping an unreachable value would leave
 * the UI with a branch nothing produces and the next reader hunting for what triggers it.

/*
 * Labels deliberately differ from item codes on three of these. The code is persisted and read by the
 * frontend, so it is fixed for good; the label is display text and should read well. Making them match would
 * let a decision taken for storage stability dictate the wording ops sees — "Paid" lands as a payment state
 * rather than a subscription one, in a set whose other members are subscription states. Where the derived
 * name is already right (SCHEDULED, EXPIRED) no label is declared at all, so a declared one always signals a
 * deliberate override.
