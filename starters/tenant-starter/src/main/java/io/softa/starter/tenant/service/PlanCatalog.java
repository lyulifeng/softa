/**
 * Plan-catalog reads that more than one caller needs, in one place.
 *
 * <p>{@link #floorPlan} in particular: "the plan a tenant starts on" was being recomputed
 * independently by the entitlement resolver and by the period write guards, and provisioning now needs
 * it a third time to write the free period at tenant creation. Three copies of a rule that decides
 * which modules a tenant may reach is three chances to disagree, and a disagreement here is invisible —
 * each caller looks correct on its own and the tenant simply gets the wrong plan.
 *
 * <p>Static, taking the {@code ModelService} as a parameter, rather than an injected component: the
 * callers all hold one already, so this way they delegate without a constructor change, and adding the
 * shared rule costs no churn in the places that were already right.
