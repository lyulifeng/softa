/**
 * One row = one subscription period: "this tenant is on this plan from this date to that date".
 *
 * <p><b>This is the record layer</b> — what ops actually enters. A tenant may hold several periods at
 * once (the current one plus renewals already agreed for later), and gaps between them are legitimate:
 * a gap simply means the tenant runs on the floor plan then.
 *
 * <p>The floor plan is never recorded here. Every tenant has it by birth, so a "floor period" and "no
 * period" would say the same thing two ways — {@link #planId} rejects the floor plan for that reason.
 *
 * <p>No status column. Where a period sits relative to a date is a pure function of
 * {@code (effectiveStartDate, effectiveEndDate, thatDate)}; storing it would create a second version of
 * the truth that has to be chased by a job. The owning {@link TenantSubscription} row does carry a
 * projected status, but it carries a projection date with it so readers can tell whether it is stale.
 *
 * <p><b>Overlapping periods are expected, not corruption.</b> Every tenant owns an open-ended period on the
 * floor plan from the day it was created, so anything sold on top of it overlaps by construction — rejecting
 * overlap would make selling impossible. Which period is in effect is decided by <b>plan tier</b>: of the
 * periods covering a date, the highest tier wins, ties broken by id so the answer is stable. That is why the
 * unique key includes {@code planId}: two rows for the same plan from the same day are still a mis-entry, but
 * two different plans from the same day are the normal case.
