     * Caps how many times a failed seed message is redelivered.
     *
     * <p>Uncapped, a tenant whose seed can never succeed retries forever: it holds a consumer slot and repeats
     * the same failure in the log — which also buries the {@code [SEED_FAILURE]} line each seed consumer
     * writes, the one line worth finding, under thousands of copies of itself. Capped, a permanent failure
     * prints three and stops.
     *
     * <p>Three attempts, spaced by {@code spring.pulsar.consumer.negative-ack-redelivery-delay}, covers an
     * application restart. That delay is not optional alongside this: at Pulsar's default the three are spent
     * in seconds, so a failure lasting as long as a restart exhausts them and writes off a tenant that would
     * have seeded fine on its own.
     *
     * <p>The type is {@code DeadLetterPolicy} because that is Pulsar's only way to bound redelivery — an
     * exhausted message has to go somewhere, so it lands on {@code <topic>-<subscription>-DLQ}. Nothing reads
     * that topic and nothing is meant to: the bucket is a side effect of the cap, not a feature. A tenant whose
     * setup never completes is surfaced by the timeout guard, and which seeder failed comes from the log.
