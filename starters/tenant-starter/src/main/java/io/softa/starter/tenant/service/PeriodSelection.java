/**
 * Which of a subscription's periods applies on a given date.
 *
 * <p>Overlapping periods are normal: every tenant owns an open-ended period on the floor plan from the day it
 * was created, so anything sold on top of it overlaps by construction. The winner is the <b>highest plan
 * tier</b> — that is what makes the free period harmless, letting a tenant on Pro be on Pro even though its
 * free period covers the same day.
 *
 * <p>Extracted because two callers need the identical answer and would otherwise each carry their own copy:
 * the projection, which writes the tenant's current plan, and the expiry reminder, which has to know what will
 * apply the day <i>after</i> a period ends. Those two disagreeing is the specific failure this prevents —
 * a reminder telling a customer their access lapses while the projection quietly moves them to the free plan
 * is not a wording problem, it is two different beliefs about the same subscription.
 *
 * <p>Static, taking the {@code ModelService}, for the same reason as {@link PlanCatalog}: the callers already
 * hold one, so sharing the rule costs them no constructor change.
