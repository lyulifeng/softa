/**
 * Typed CRUD for subscription periods — <b>the single write entry point</b> for the record layer.
 *
 * <p>Two things happen on every write here and nowhere else: the four guards (§ below) and the projection
 * refresh of the owning subscription row. Anything that reaches the table without passing through this
 * interface skips both, which is why the generic model endpoints for this model are shadowed rather than
 * left open — see {@code TenantSubscriptionPeriodController}.
 *
 * <h3>Guards</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>End date must not precede start date.</b> An empty end date means open-ended.</li>
 *   <li><b>At most one period on the floor plan.</b> That row is the tenant's baseline free access, written
 *       by provisioning; a second one would put the same entitlement in two places, and whichever was
 *       edited the other would still be granting access.</li>
 *   <li><b>The floor period's start date cannot be changed.</b> It is the tenant's creation day — the date
 *       free access began, which is history rather than a setting. Its <i>end</i> date is settable, and that
 *       is the whole mechanism for time-boxing free access.</li>
 *   <li><b>The floor period cannot be deleted.</b> The entitlement resolver reads a missing floor row as
 *       "this tenant predates the migration" and falls back to granting the floor plan's modules, so
 *       deleting the row would silently restore the very access an operator had just revoked by ending it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Overlap is deliberately not guarded.</b> It used to be, on the reasoning that "the period covering
 * today" had to be unambiguous. It no longer can be: provisioning gives every tenant an open-ended floor
 * period, so every sale overlaps at least that one. Ambiguity is resolved by <b>plan tier</b> instead —
 * highest tier covering the date wins — which is what makes "sell Pro on top of free" mean the tenant gets
 * Pro. Back-filling historical periods and editing an ended period's dates are therefore both plain edits.
 *
 * <p>Guards 2–4 apply to updates as much as inserts, and the delete paths carry guard 4 as well, so there is
 * no write route that can leave a subscription without exactly one floor period.
